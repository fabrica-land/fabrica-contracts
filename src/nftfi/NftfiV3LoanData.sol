     * @param loanERC20Denomination - The address of the ERC20 contract of the currency being used as principal/interest
     * for this loan.
     * @param loanPrincipalAmount - The original sum of money transferred from lender to borrower at the beginning of
     * the loan, measured in loanERC20Denomination's smallest units.
     * @param maximumRepaymentAmount - The maximum amount of money that the borrower would be required to retrieve their
     * collateral, measured in the smallest units of the ERC20 currency used for the loan.
     * @param nftCollateralContract - The address of the the NFT collateral contract.
     * @param nftCollateralWrapper - The NFTfi wrapper of the NFT collateral contract.
     * @param nftCollateralId - The ID within the NFTCollateralContract for the NFT being used as collateral for this
     * loan. The NFT is stored within this contract during the duration of the loan.
     * @param loanStartTime - The block.timestamp when the loan first began (measured in seconds).
     * @param loanDuration - The amount of time (measured in seconds) that can elapse before the lender can liquidate
     * the loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * @param loanAdminFee - The percent (measured in basis points) of the interest earned that will be
     * taken as a fee by the contract admins when the loan is repaid. The fee is stored in the loan struct to prevent an
     * attack where the contract admins could adjust the fee right before a loan is repaid, and take all of the interest
     * earned.

     * @param borrower
     * @param lender
     * @param escrow - address of the escrow contract the collateral is stored in
     * @param isProRata - indicates if a loan is pro-rata or not

     * @param signer - The address of the signer. The borrower for `acceptOffer`
     * @param nonce - The nonce referred here is not the same as an Ethereum account's nonce.
     * We are referring instead to a nonce that is used by the lender or the borrower when they are first signing
     * off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an
     * off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once perÂ user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the
     * lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:
     * - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     * - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitment()
     * , which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains
     * that nonce.
     * @param expiry - Date when the signature expires
     * @param signature - The ECDSA signature of the borrower or the lender, obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing
     * the following combination of parameters:
     * - Lender:
     *   - Offer.loanERC20Denomination
     *   - Offer.loanPrincipalAmount
